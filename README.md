#MD5 Hash Classification Tool
##Overview
The MD5 Hash Classification Tool is a web-based application that allows users to classify MD5 hash values as either malicious or non-malicious using a pre-trained machine learning model. The tool leverages a combination of numeric and text-based features to make predictions and provides a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.

##Features
Predicts whether an MD5 hash is malicious or not.
Accepts user input for MD5 hash values.
Provides instant predictions on the user interface.
